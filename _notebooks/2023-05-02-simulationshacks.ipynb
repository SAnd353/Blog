Clicking on a red box makes it return to being grey and a different box turns red. The objective of the game is to click on as many red boxes as possible while clicking on as few grey boxes as possible in 30 seconds. Clicking on a red square increases the score by 2 and clicking on a gray square decreases the score by 1. This is supposed to simulate wack-a-mole gameplay."
