            "content": "What is a Hashtable/Hashmap? . A hashtable is a data structure that with a collection of key-value pairs, where each key maps to a value, and the keys must be unique and hashable. . In Python there is a built in hashtable known as a Dictionary. | . The primary purpose of a hashtable is to provide efficient lookup, insertion, and deletion operations. When an element is to be inserted into the hashtable, a hash function is used to map the key to a specific index in the underlying array that is used to store the key-value pairs. The value is then stored at that index. When searching for a value, the hash function is used again to find the index where the value is stored. . The key advantage of a hashtable over other data structures like arrays and linked lists is its average-case time complexity for lookup, insertion, and deletion operations. . The typical time complexity of a hashtable is O(1). | . What is Hashing and Collision? . Hashing is the process of mapping a given key to a value in a hash table or hashmap, using a hash function. The hash function takes the key as input and produces a hash value or hash code, which is then used to determine the index in the underlying array where the value is stored. The purpose of hashing is to provide a quick and efficient way to access data, by eliminating the need to search through an entire data structure to find a value. . However, it is possible for two different keys to map to the same hash value, resulting in a collision. When a collision occurs, there are different ways to resolve it, depending on the collision resolution strategy used. . Python&#39;s dictionary implementation is optimized to handle collisions efficiently, and the performance of the dictionary is generally very good, even in the presence of collisions. However, if the number of collisions is very high, the performance of the dictionary can degrade, so it is important to choose a good hash function that minimizes collisions when designing a Python dictionary. . What is a Set? . my_set = set([1, 2, 3, 2, 1]) print(my_set) # What do you notice in the output? # It outputs only 1, 2, and 3 (only unique values are outputted) # It seems to output as a dictionary/hash tables # Why do you think Sets are in the same tech talk as Hashmaps/Hashtables? # They are similar data structures # No duplicates . {1, 2, 3} .

In the second code block, change the baseWidth to rescale the image. . from IPython.display import Image, display from pathlib import Path # prepares a series of images def image_data(path=Path(&quot;images/&quot;), images=None): # path of static images is defaulted for image in images: # File to open image[&#39;filename&#39;] = path / image[&#39;file&#39;] # file with path return images def image_display(images): for image in images: display(Image(filename=image[&#39;filename&#39;])) if __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;: lassen_volcano = image_data(images=[{&#39;source&#39;: &quot;Peter Carolin&quot;, &#39;label&#39;: &quot;Lassen Volcano&quot;, &#39;file&#39;: &quot;lassen-volcano.jpg&quot;}]) image_display(lassen_volcano) . from IPython.display import HTML, display from pathlib import Path from PIL import Image as pilImage from io import BytesIO import base64 # prepares a series of images def image_data(path=Path(&quot;images/&quot;), images=None): # path of static images is defaulted for image in images: # File to open image[&#39;filename&#39;] = path / image[&#39;file&#39;] # file with path return images def scale_image(img): baseWidth = 625 #baseWidth = 1250 #baseWidth = 2500 #baseWidth = 5000 # see the effect of doubling or halfing the baseWidth #baseWidth = 10000 #baseWidth = 20000 #baseWidth = 40000 scalePercent = (baseWidth/float(img.size[0])) scaleHeight = int((float(img.size[1])*float(scalePercent))) scale = (baseWidth, scaleHeight) return img.resize(scale) def image_to_base64(img, format): with BytesIO() as buffer: img.save(buffer, format) return base64.b64encode(buffer.getvalue()).decode() def image_management(image): # path of static images is defaulted # Image open return PIL image object img = pilImage.open(image[&#39;filename&#39;]) # Python Image Library operations image[&#39;format&#39;] = img.format image[&#39;mode&#39;] = img.mode image[&#39;size&#39;] = img.size image[&#39;width&#39;], image[&#39;height&#39;] = img.size image[&#39;pixels&#39;] = image[&#39;width&#39;] * image[&#39;height&#39;] # Scale the Image img = scale_image(img) image[&#39;pil&#39;] = img image[&#39;scaled_size&#39;] = img.size image[&#39;scaled_width&#39;], image[&#39;scaled_height&#39;] = img.size image[&#39;scaled_pixels&#39;] = image[&#39;scaled_width&#39;] * image[&#39;scaled_height&#39;] # Scaled HTML image[&#39;html&#39;] = &#39;&lt;img src=&quot;data:image/png;base64,%s&quot;&gt;&#39; % image_to_base64(image[&#39;pil&#39;], image[&#39;format&#39;]) if __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;: # Use numpy to concatenate two arrays images = image_data(images = [{&#39;source&#39;: &quot;Peter Carolin&quot;, &#39;label&#39;: &quot;Lassen Volcano&quot;, &#39;file&#39;: &quot;lassen-volcano.jpg&quot;}]) # Display meta data, scaled view, and grey scale for each image for image in images: image_management(image) print(&quot;- meta data --&quot;) print(image[&#39;label&#39;]) print(image[&#39;source&#39;]) print(image[&#39;format&#39;]) print(image[&#39;mode&#39;]) print(&quot;Original size: &quot;, image[&#39;size&#39;], &quot; pixels: &quot;, f&quot;{image[&#39;pixels&#39;]:,}&quot;) print(&quot;Scaled size: &quot;, image[&#39;scaled_size&#39;], &quot; pixels: &quot;, f&quot;{image[&#39;scaled_pixels&#39;]:,}&quot;) print(&quot;-- original image --&quot;) display(HTML(image[&#39;html&#39;])) . Do you think this is a time complexity or space complexity or both problem? . This is mostly a time complexity problem, but it is likely a bit of a space complexity problem as well. | . Big O Notation . Constant O(1) | Linear O(n) | Quadratic O(n^2) | Logarithmic O(logn) | Exponential (O(2^n)) | . numbers = list(range(1000)) print(numbers) . Constant O(1) . Time . An example of a constant time algorithm is accessing a specific element in an array. It does not matter how large the array is, accessing an element in the array takes the same amount of time. Therefore, the time complexity of this operation is constant, denoted by O(1). . print(numbers[263]) ncaa_bb_ranks = {1:&quot;Alabama&quot;,2:&quot;Houston&quot;, 3:&quot;Purdue&quot;, 4:&quot;Kansas&quot;} #look up a value in a dictionary given a key print(ncaa_bb_ranks[1]) . Space . This function takes two number inputs and returns their sum. The function does not create any additional data structures or variables that are dependent on the input size, so its space complexity is constant, or O(1). Regardless of how large the input numbers are, the function will always require the same amount of memory to execute. . def sum(a, b): return a + b print(sum(90,88)) print(sum(.9,.88)) . Linear O(n) . Time . An example of a linear time algorithm is traversing a list or an array. When the size of the list or array increases, the time taken to traverse it also increases linearly with the size. Hence, the time complexity of this operation is O(n), where n is the size of the list or array being traversed. . for i in numbers: print(i) . Space . This function takes a list of elements arr as input and returns a new list with the elements in reverse order. The function creates a new list reversed_arr of the same size as arr to store the reversed elements. The size of reversed_arr depends on the size of the input arr, so the space complexity of this function is O(n). As the input size increases, the amount of memory required to execute the function also increases linearly. . def reverse_list(arr): n = len(arr) reversed_arr = [None] * n #create a list of None based on the length or arr for i in range(n): reversed_arr[n-i-1] = arr[i] #stores the value at the index of arr to the value at the index of reversed_arr starting at the beginning for arr and end for reversed_arr return reversed_arr print(numbers) print(reverse_list(numbers)) . Quadratic O(n^2) . Time . An example of a quadratic time algorithm is nested loops. When there are two nested loops that both iterate over the same collection, the time taken to complete the algorithm grows quadratically with the size of the collection. Hence, the time complexity of this operation is O(n^2), where n is the size of the collection being iterated over. . for i in numbers: for j in numbers: print(i,j) . Space . This function takes two matrices matrix1 and matrix2 as input and returns their product as a new matrix. The function creates a new matrix result with dimensions m by n to store the product of the input matrices. The size of result depends on the size of the input matrices, so the space complexity of this function is O(n^2). As the size of the input matrices increases, the amount of memory required to execute the function also increases quadratically. . Main take away is that a new matrix is created. | . def multiply_matrices(matrix1, matrix2): m = len(matrix1) n = len(matrix2[0]) result = [[0] * n] * m #this creates the new matrix based on the size of matrix 1 and 2 for i in range(m): for j in range(n): for k in range(len(matrix2)): result[i][j] += matrix1[i][k] * matrix2[k][j] return result print(multiply_matrices([[1,2],[3,4]], [[3,4],[1,2]])) . Logarithmic O(logn) . Time . An example of a log time algorithm is binary search. Binary search is an algorithm that searches for a specific element in a sorted list by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half. As a result, the time taken to complete the search grows logarithmically with the size of the list. Hence, the time complexity of this operation is O(log n), where n is the size of the list being searched. . def binary_search(arr, low, high, target): while low &lt;= high: mid = (low + high) // 2 #integer division if arr[mid] == target: return mid elif arr[mid] &lt; target: low = mid + 1 else: high = mid - 1 target = 263 result = binary_search(numbers, 0, len(numbers) - 1, target) print(result) . Space . The same algorithm above has a O(logn) space complexity. The function takes an array arr, its lower and upper bounds low and high, and a target value target. The function searches for target within the bounds of arr by recursively dividing the search space in half until the target is found or the search space is empty. The function does not create any new data structures that depend on the size of arr. Instead, the function uses the call stack to keep track of the recursive calls. Since the maximum depth of the recursive calls is O(logn), where n is the size of arr, the space complexity of this function is O(logn). As the size of arr increases, the amount of memory required to execute the function grows logarithmically. . Exponential O(2^n) . Time . An example of an O(2^n) algorithm is the recursive implementation of the Fibonacci sequence. The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1. The recursive implementation of the Fibonacci sequence calculates each number by recursively calling itself with the two preceding numbers until it reaches the base case (i.e., the first or second number in the sequence). The algorithm takes O(2^n) time in the worst case because it has to calculate each number in the sequence by making two recursive calls. . def fibonacci(n): if n &lt;= 1: return n else: return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2) #print(fibonacci(5)) #print(fibonacci(10)) #print(fibonacci(20)) print(fibonacci(30)) #print(fibonacci(40)) . Space . This function takes a set s as input and generates all possible subsets of s. The function does this by recursively generating the subsets of the set without the first element, and then adding the first element to each of those subsets to generate the subsets that include the first element. The function creates a new list for each recursive call that stores the subsets, and each element in the list is a new list that represents a subset. The number of subsets that can be generated from a set of size n is 2^n, so the space complexity of this function is O(2^n). As the size of the input set increases, the amount of memory required to execute the function grows exponentially. . def generate_subsets(s): if not s: return [[]] subsets = generate_subsets(s[1:]) return [[s[0]] + subset for subset in subsets] + subsets print(generate_subsets([1,2,3])) #print(generate_subsets(numbers)) . Using the time library, we are able to see the difference in time it takes to calculate the fibonacci function above. . Based on what is known about the other time complexities, hypothesize the resulting elapsed time if the function is replaced. | . import time start_time = time.time() print(fibonacci(34)) end_time = time.time() total_time = end_time - start_time print(&quot;Time taken:&quot;, total_time, &quot;seconds&quot;) start_time = time.time() print(fibonacci(35)) end_time = time.time() total_time = end_time - start_time print(&quot;Time taken:&quot;, total_time, &quot;seconds&quot;) . Hacks . Record your findings when testing the time elapsed of the different algorithms. | Although we will go more in depth later, time complexity is a key concept that relates to the different sorting algorithms. Do some basic research on the different types of sorting algorithms and their time complexity. Selection sorting algorithms have O(n^2) time complexity | Binary sorting algorithms have O(logN) time complexity | . | Why is time and space complexity important when choosing an algorithm? A programmer should want their algorithms to be efficient in both time spent and memory used for convenience and cost. | . | Should you always use a constant time algorithm / Should you never use an exponential time algorithm? Explain? You shouldn&#39;t always use a constant time algorithm. For example, a simple sorting algorithm with O(n) time complexity would take longer to sort a large data set than a binary search algorithm (O(logN) time complexity). Exponential time algorithms could run faster than constant time algorithms with small data sets. | . | What are some general patterns that you noticed to determine each algorithm&#39;s time and space complexity? loops, looping conditions Complete the Time and Space Complexity analysis questions linked below.

The Titanic dataset is a popular dataset for data analysis and machine learning. In the context of machine learning, accuracy refers to the percentage of correctly classified instances in a set of predictions. In this case, the testing data is a subset of the original Titanic dataset that the decision tree model has not seen during training......After training the decision tree model on the training data, we can evaluate its performance on the testing data by making predictions on the testing data and comparing them to the actual outcomes. The accuracy of the decision tree classifier on the testing data tells us how well the model generalizes to new data that it hasn&#39;t seen before......For example, if the accuracy of the decision tree classifier on the testing data is 0.8 (or 80%), this means that 80% of the predictions made by the model on the testing data were correct....Chance of survival could be done using various machine learning techniques, including decision trees, logistic regression, or support vector machines, among others. . Code Below prepares data for further analysis and provides an Accuracy. IMO, you would insert a new passenger and predict survival. Datasets could be used on various factors like prediction if a player will hit a Home Run, or a Stock will go up or down.

My group’s project: Etracker . . | My group had done a lot of preparation for Night at the Museum, so we were all nervous and excited. | The review with Mr. Mortensen went well and a good number of people were interested in our project | Overall, I’d say that N@TM was very beneficial for my group as a whole | . Recipe Project . . One of my friends was in the group who made the recipe project, so I was very curious about it. | The project allows the user to type in a food, resulting in many recipes for the inputted food to be given. | The project also had very strong aesthetics | Overall, I think this project was really interesting | . Snake Project . . Another project I saw was a Snake project | Essentially, the group who made the project coded a snake game. | I think the project was really techinically impressive. | . Final thoughts . Unfortunately, I had a prior commitment at 6:45, so I couldn’t stay at N@TM for long. If I could have stayed longer, I would have taken my time to check out other AP CSP projects and projects from fine arts classes. | Despite this, I still think that N@TM was a lot of fun and a really valuable experience. | .",

Is it good business? . TikTok is typically used by people between the ages of 13 and 24 and Facebook is typically used by people 25 and up. Data supports this. Importantly, TikTok’s user base is almost entirely teenagers and young adults. | There isn’t purposeful exclusion in these platforms. | This is harmful because TikTok has been shown to damage the attention span of its users, and much of TikTok’s user base are still developing. | There isn’t anything to be corrected about TikTok because it doesn’t necessarily target younger people. | It is beneficial to TikTok’s business because younger people tend to have more time and thus more time to use social media. | . Why do virtual assistants have female voices? Amazon, Alexa Google, Apple Siri. Was this purposeful? Is it harmful? Should it be corrected? Is it good business? . Virtual assistants have female voices to articulate vowels better. This was likely purposeful. | It isn’t too harmful because these virtual assistants give users the option to switch the voice from a female one to a male one. However, it could perpetuate harmful ideas of gender roles. | This should be corrected by not having a default gender for virtual assitants and giving the choice to the user when devices are being set up. | It doesn’t have much of an effect on business. | . Talk about an algorithm that influences your decisions, think about these companies (ie FAANG - Facebook, Amazon, Apple,Netflix, Google) . Google’s algorithms influences what ideas I get exposed to.

What about Del Norte crowdsourcing? Could your project be better weith crowdsourcing? . | My project could be improved by crowdsourcing workout tips and ideas and showing them to viewers (with some sort of filtering, of course). This could be crowdsourced from Del Norte. | . What kind of data could you capture at N@tM to make evening interesting? Perhaps use this data to impress Teachers during finals week. . I could record what kinds projects people in AP CSP made. I can use this data to find trends in what AP CSP students are interested in. | I already know that in my period alone, three groups (including mine) are making projects that track fitness/workouts. This tells me that AP CSP students are very interested in making projects to track workouts. However the sample size is too small for me to make any good assumptions. | .",

Think of a potential harmful effect of your project. . A potential harmful effect of my project is people creating goals for themselves so excessive that they may even be impossible. The project is very focused on allowing the user to have ultimate control over their fitness, but part of that means letting the user freely create goals for themselves. A users who sets an impossible goal, that user will inevitably be disappointed and potentially burnt out in regards to fitness. | . 3. Answer with an opinion and learnings so far this year: What are pros/cons on internet blockers at router and lack of admin password on lab machines at school? . Pros include helping students stay on task and be more productive. Cons include students being unable to use certain tools that are necessary for schoolwork or productivity. For example, the blockers present at school prevent students from connecting to AWS instances without a VPN; AWS is important for APCSP, so this is actually harmful for productivity. . 4. What concerns do you have personally about the digital divide? For yourself or for others. . I’m concerned about people getting figuratively left behind just because they never had the opportunity to become “digitally empowered”. Those who are “empowered” will almost certainly receive more opportunities in things like job opportunities. . Other questions . 1. Come up with three of your own Beneficial and corresponding Harmful Effects of Computing . One beneficial effect of computing is people being able to communiate over long distances very efficiently. Digital messaging has allowed for people to stay connected despite physical limitations. However, this creates a corresponding harmful effect of people spending too much time messaging others and mixing up priorities. | Another beneficial effect of computing is ease of sharing information. For example, modern news sites have made newspapers more or less obsolete. However this creates a corresponding harmful effect of people being able to spread misinformation extremely easily. | One beneficial effect of computing is the simplification of peforming complicated tasks like mathematical computation. However, this has resulted in people being less competent in such tasks and overrelying on computers. | . 2. Talk about dopamine issues above. Real? Parent conspiracy? Anything that is impacting your personal study and success in High School? . Issues like those discussed in the lesson are definitely real, but the one discussed in the lesson is an extreme example that will never apply to a vast majority of people.

An Object is used like many other Python variables. | A Class has ... a collection of data, these are called Attributes and in Python are pre-fixed using the keyword self | a collection of Functions/Procedures. These are called *Methods when they exist inside a Class definition. | . | An Object is created from the Class/Template. Characteristics of objects ... an Object is an Instance of the Class/Template | there can be many Objects created from the same Class | each Object contains its own Instance Data | the data is setup by the Constructor, this is the &quot;init&quot; method in a Python class | all methods in the Class/Template become part of the Object, methods are accessed using dot notation (object.method()) | . | A Python Class allow for the definition of @ decorators, these allow access to instance data without the use of functions ... @property decorator (aka getter).

As more and more developers use APIs, they build standards in how you setup a client, send requests and receive information... . Covid19 RapidAPI Example . To begin the API journey. You need to find an API provider. . RapidAPI is a great option. You must setup and account, but there are many free options. | Goto this page for starters, the Corona virus World and India data- Under Code Snippets pick Python - Requests | . RapidAPI, you will select Python Requests type of code to work with you Notebook. . The url is the endpoint to which the API is directed | The headers is a dictionary data structure to send special messaging to the endpoint | The requests.request() python function is used to send a request and retrieve their responses | The response variable receives result of of the request in JSON text | . Next step, is to format the response according to your data science needs . &quot;&quot;&quot; Requests is a HTTP library for the Python programming language.
