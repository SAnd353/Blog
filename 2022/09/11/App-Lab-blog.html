    <p>My quiz is a 3 question biology quiz where each question has two choices.
My quiz keeps track of how many questions the user gets correct with a variable and reports it as a score at the very end.
I wanted my quiz to use functions to avoid repeating code, so I made a correct answer function and an incorrect answer function.
As for procedural abstraction, the correct and incorrect functions use the next question as parameters and uses that when determining where the “Next” button leads to.</p>

<p>It was challenging to work understand javascript, but the blocks certainly helped. It took me some time to discover how the onEvent function and turtle commands worked.</p>
