<p>During Night at the Museum, I looked at other APCSP projects, including “Baboon Juice” and “Fitness Forever”. Beyond APCSP, I looked around at 3D Animation and Digital Media Arts. The room we had to present in was extremely cramped and stuffy.</p>

<p>For next trimester, I’ll plan things out more exhaustively to have better time management.</p>
