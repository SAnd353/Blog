<p>Somebody could find ways to be more comfortable with computers and computing such as by learning how to code or learning how the internet works.</p>
<h1 id="how-does-someone-that-is-empowered-help-someone-that-is-not-empowered-describe-something-you-could-do-at-del-norte-hs">How does someone that is empowered help someone that is not empowered? Describe something you could do at Del Norte HS.</h1>
<p>An empowered person could help somebody that isn’t empowered by helping the unempowered person understand digital technologies. Something I could do at DNHS is helping classmates who are struggling in APCSP because of lack of experience.</p>
<h1 id="is-paper-or-red-tape-blocking-digital-empowerment-are-there-such-barriers-at-del-norte-elsewhere">Is paper or red tape blocking digital empowerment? Are there such barriers at Del Norte? Elsewhere?</h1>
<p>Things like poverty stop people from being digitally empowered. Poverty stops people from even having the opportunity to use technology. Poverty exists everywhere, including Del Norte.</p>
