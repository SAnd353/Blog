  <li>The portion of my project that I’ll use for CPT is the workout calendar, where users can plan out their workouts for the coming month.</li>
  <li>The frontend of the workout calendar will have a conventional calendar that displays days for the current month with the days acting as buttons. The user can click on a day and a prompt asking for workout details will appear. The user can either hit “cancel” to remove the prompt or type in workout details and click “Add” for that workout to be added to the calendar on the day that was clicked. The user may select a certain day’s workout and edit or remove it. Whenever workout data is changed, the program will send the current data in the form of a dictionary of lists (each list corresponding to a day) to the backend, which will save the data in an SQL database. Whenver the user loads the calenar, the frontend will retrieve data from the backend and pass it through an algorithm that adds the saved workouts to their correct corresponding days.</li>
  <li>In the video, I’ll demonstrate adding, editing, and removing a workout as well as the database being updated after each of these events.</li>
