    <p>I got 48/50 on the MCQ.</p>
<ol>
  <li>The first question that I got wrong was question 42, “Car manufacturer simulations”, and I chose choice “A”, which was “I and II only”. The question asked how car simulation software could be used in the context of designing a new car. The correct answer was “D”, “I, II, and III”. I thought that customers wouldn’t be interested in a simulation and would rather see a working model, but it seems that this isn’t the case.</li>
  <li>The second question that I got wrong was question 44, “Simulate customer wait times at a bank”, and I chose choice “C”. The correct answer was choice “D”. I got this wrong because I didn’t think that the simulation could be useful for finding alternatives. Furthermore, even though actual customer data wasn’t available in the context of the question, the results are still usable.</li>
