<ul>
  <li>this is largely done with Javascript.</li>
  <li>It makes use of Javascript’s built in Date() object functionality</li>
  <li>The JS creates “daySquare” elements based upon the current month and current day of the week</li>
  <li>In the function that creates “daySquare” elements, the number of days in the first week of the month being generated that belong to the previous month is accounted for
    <ul>
      <li>This is so that the function can create an appropriate number of “padding days”</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Furthermore, whenever a daySquare is created, addeventlistener is used to make them clickable buttons</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="things-to-work-on-and-improve">Things to work on and improve</h1>
<ul>
  <li>Instead of making the days, when clicked, immediately ask for a new workout, make them open the currently saved workouts to the side and have buttons for adding, removing, and changing workouts there (Making things more intelligent)</li>
  <li>Saving and retrieving data to the backend (POST and GET requests with fetch())</li>
  <li>Making it more space-efficient (currently does NOT work well with site-theme (Modernist))</li>
</ul>
