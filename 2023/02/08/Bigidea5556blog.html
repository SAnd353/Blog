Review the license types in relationship to this Tech Talk and make some notes in your personal blog.</h1>
<ul>
  <li>Among all of the license options, I like the GPL license and MIT license the most</li>
  <li>I like the GPL license a bit more since no matter how people use code with a GPL license, it has to be made public (creating transparency)
    <h1 id="in-your-blog-summarize-the-discussions-and-personal-analysis-on-software-licensesoptions-digital-rights-and-other-legal-and-ethical-thoughts-from-this-college-board-topic">In your blog, summarize the discussions and personal analysis on Software Licenses/Options, Digital Rights, and other Legal and Ethical thoughts from this College Board topic.</h1>
  </li>
  <li>Licenses let software engineers make money off of their software.</li>
  <li>However, this comes with the drawback of reduced progress. If a highly important piece of software is made to be close-sourced, people may have to find inferior alternatives rather than simply using the best option.</li>
  <li>Yet, it is important that people can safely profit from their work if they chose to.
    <h1 id="make-a-license-for-your-personal-blog-and-team-repositories-for-the-cpt-project-be-sure-to-have-a-license-for-both-team-github-repositories-frontendbackend-document-licenses-you-picked-and-why-fyi-frontend-since-it-is-built-on-github-pages-may-come-with-a-license-and-restrictions-document-in-blog-how-team-made-license-choice-and-process-of-update">Make a license for your personal (blog) and Team repositories for the CPT project. Be sure to have a license for both Team GitHub repositories (frontend/backend). Document license(s) you picked and why. FYI, frontend, since it is built on GitHub pages may come with a license and restrictions. Document in blog how team made license choice and process of update.</h1>
  </li>
  <li>My team is using the GNU GPLv3 license.</li>
  <li>I liked the idea of having open-source code, but I wouldn’t feel comfortable with it unless there were some restrictions.</li>
  <li>The GNU GPLv3 license requires people who use the code in question to provide credit and make the resulting code public, so transparency is required.</li>
  <li>My blog is using Apache License 2.0. This is the license of the original fastpages repository, and I feel like I shouldn’t change it since the inner workings of the blog weren’t made by me and came straight from the fastpages repository.

    <h1 id="describe-pii-you-have-seen-on-project-in-compsci-principles">Describe PII you have seen on project in CompSci Principles.</h1>
  </li>
  <li>I’ve seen names, pictures, and school names on CSP projects.
    <h1 id="what-are-your-feelings-about-pii-and-your-personal-exposure">What are your feelings about PII and your personal exposure?</h1>
  </li>
  <li>I think it is extremely important to protect PII and to reduce personal exposure as much as possible (to a reasonable extent, of course).
    <h1 id="describe-good-and-bad-passwords-what-is-another-step-that-is-used-to-assist-in-authentication">Describe good and bad passwords? What is another step that is used to assist in authentication.</h1>
  </li>
  <li>Good passwords are long and complex and avoid using dictionary words.</li>
  <li>Another thing used to assist in authentication is multi-factor authentication, such as when users who want to log in have to provide credentials and a code that gets sent to their phone.
    <h1 id="try-to-describe-symmetric-and-asymmetric-encryption">Try to describe Symmetric and Asymmetric encryption.</h1>
  </li>
  <li>Symmetric encryption is encryption that is encoded and decoded with the same key.</li>
  <li>Asymmetric encryption is encryption that is encoded and decoded with different keys.
    <h1 id="provide-an-example-of-encryption-we-used-in-aws-deployment">Provide an example of encryption we used in AWS deployment.</h1>
  </li>
  <li>AWS encrypts server-side data with AES-256</li>
  <li>Furthermore, AWS uses RSA (an asymmetric cryptosystem)
    <h1 id="describe-a-phishing-scheme-you-have-learned-about-the-hard-way-describe-some-other-phishing-techniques">Describe a phishing scheme you have learned about the hard way. Describe some other phishing techniques.</h1>
  </li>
  <li>I can’t recall a time where I’ve ever fell victim to phishing, but I have received emails and text messages that are obviously phishing attempts.</li>
  <li>These emails include some sort of call-to-action for the receiver, whether it be by creating panic or making receivers think they are on the cusp of receiving something valuable.</li>
  <li>For example, a phishing email can impersonate a large company and tell the receiver that they’ve just won a large sum of money and that the receiver just needs to click on a link to claim the money. This link may lead directly to malware.</li>
</ul>
