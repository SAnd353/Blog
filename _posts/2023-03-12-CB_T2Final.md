# I got 45/50 on the trimester 2 MCQ
1. The first question I got wrong was question 2. I chose D, "The user's public keys used for encryption". The correct answer was A, "A group of cookies stored by the userâ€™s Web browser". I didn't think about how public keys, as the name would suggest, aren't meant to be private, and that browser cookies can contain a very large amount of private information.
2. The second question I got wrong was question 5. I simply misinterpreted the question
3. The third question I got wrong was question 21. I'm not too sure how I got this wrong. I must have not read the question very closely.
4. The fourth question I got wrong was question 42. Much like the third question I got wrong, I'm not sure how I got this wrong.
5. The fifth question I got wrong was question 50. I correctly chose option D, but I shouldn't have chose option B and should have instead chose option A. Although option B required less steps than option A for the given list sizes, the number of steps option B uses increases exponentially, while option A's number of steps increaes linearly.

# Reflection
For future MCQs, I'll have to be better with not misreading questions.
