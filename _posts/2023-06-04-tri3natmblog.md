- This trimester's Night at the Museum was very interesting. There were so many people and it was really energetic. 
# Projects
## My group's project: Octo Game(s)
- My group is among the larger ones, so we felt that we had to make a good showing
- Our project had some rougher edges but the final product is still quite impressive

## Snake + Physics game Project
- One of my friends was in the group who made this project, so I was very curious about it.
- They created a leaderboard with a snake game and a physics simulator
- the physics simulator was pretty impressive

## Java project
- This project had a login system and taught users Java using coding challenges
- I was really impressed with the login system and the aesthetics

# Final thoughts
- N@TM this year certainly didn't disappoint
- It was a bit hectic, but it was certainly enjoyable
