# 1. Come up with three of your own Beneficial and corresponding Harmful Effects of Computing
- One beneficial effect of computing is people being able to communiate over long distances very efficiently. Digital messaging has allowed for people to stay connected despite physical limitations.

- Another beneficial effect of computing is ease of sharing information. For example, modern news sites have made newspapers more or less obsolete. However this creates a corresponding harmful effect of people being able to spread misinformation extremely easily.
