I got 62/67
- I should have read Q14's responses more carefully
- I should have put more thought into III of Q17
- I should have read choices C and D of Q32 more carefully
- I didn't think that O(2n) and O(n^2) were reasonable for when n is very large
- I should have looked more closely at question 62's responses
