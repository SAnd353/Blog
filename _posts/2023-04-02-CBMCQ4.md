I got 46/50 on MCQ #4
- I got question 6 wrong. I'll need to brush up on knowledge regarding packet encryption
- I got question 20 wrong. I didn't think of using the phone number of one known criminal and finding who that person called to find other criminals.
- I got question 37 wrong. I didn't think that an algorithm that ran in n^2 time is reasonable
- I got question 47 wrong. This was a foolish error on my part.

# Reflection
- Overall, I did well.
- I'll need to think more critically on certain questions to score higher.
