- This trimester's Night at the Museum was very interesting. Not only was there a lot to show in regards to my group's project, but significantly more people that weren't from AP CSP were interested in our project. Furthermore, the other projects were really interesting too, so there was never a dull moment.
# Projects
## My group's project: Etracker

- My group had done a lot of preparation for Night at the Museum, so we were all nervous and excited.
- The review with Mr. Mortensen went well and a good number of people were interested in our project
- Overall, I'd say that N@TM was very beneficial for my group as a whole

## Recipe Project

- One of my friends was in the group who made the recipe project, so I was very curious about it.
- The project allows the user to type in a food, resulting in many recipes for the inputted food to be given.
- The project also had very strong aesthetics
- Overall, I think this project was really interesting

## Snake Project

- Another project I saw was a Snake project
- Essentially, the group who made the project coded a snake game.
- I think the project was really techinically impressive.

# Final thoughts
- Unfortunately, I had a prior commitment at 6:45, so I couldn't stay at N@TM for long. If I could have stayed longer, I would have taken my time to check out other AP CSP projects and projects from fine arts classes.
- Despite this, I still think that N@TM was a lot of fun and a really valuable experience.
