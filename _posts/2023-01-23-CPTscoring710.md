# Project 7
- [x] Program Purpose and Function
    - [x] Input (Video)
    - [x] Program Functionality (Video)
    - [x] Output (Video)
    - [x] Purpose
    - [x] Functionality
    - [x] Input/Output
- [ ] Data Abstraction
    - [ ] 2 program segments (shows list  + shows the list being used)
    - [x] Name of the list
    - [x] What the data in the list represents
- [ ] Managing Complexity
    - [ ] Shows list being used to manage complexity
    - [ ] How the lists manages complexity
- [ ] Procedural Abstraction
    - [ ] Showing a student-developed procedure with at least one parameter and where it's called
    - [x] Describing what the procedure does and how it contributes to the functionality of the program
- [x] Algorithm Implementation
    - [x] Student-developed algorithm that includes sequencing, selection, and iteration
    - [x] Detailed explanation
- [x] Testing
    - [x] Describes two calls of a procedure that pass different argument(s) and cause different segments of code in the algorithm to execute
    - [x] Describes conditions tested by each call
    - [x] Identifies results of each call

CollegeBoard graded, "Showing a student-developed procedure with at least one parameter and where it's called" and, "Describing what the procedure does and how it contributes to the functionality of the program" differently.
Student primarily shows a lack in understanding of complexity management

    - [ ] Describes two calls of a procedure that pass different argument(s) and cause different segments of code in the algorithm to execute
    - [ ] Describes conditions tested by each call
    - [x] Identifies results of each call

Collegeboard graded "How the lists manages complexity", "Detailed explanation", and "Identifies results of each call" differently.
Student shows a lack of understanding in complexity management, how much detail is needed, and what results of each call entails.

Collegeboard graded "Describes conditions tested by each call" differently.
The student shows a lack of understanding of testing.

# Reflection
I'll need to keep track of all of the sub-requirements when coding my project for it to meet all of them.
