# How does someone empower themself in a digital world?
Somebody could find ways to be more comfortable with computers and computing such as by learning how to code or learning how the internet works.
# How does someone that is empowered help someone that is not empowered? Describe something you could do at Del Norte HS.
An empowered person could help somebody that isn't empowered by helping the unempowered person understand digital technologies. Something I could do at DNHS is helping classmates who are struggling in APCSP because of lack of experience.
# Is paper or red tape blocking digital empowerment? Are there such barriers at Del Norte? Elsewhere?
Things like poverty stop people from being digitally empowered. Poverty stops people from even having the opportunity to use technology. Poverty exists everywhere, including Del Norte.
