# 1. Think of three beneficial effects of your projects based on 5.1 Unit
- One potential beneficial effect of my project is fitness becoming more approachable.
- A second potential beneficial effect of my project is greater physical fitness for many people
- A third potential beneficial effect of my project is people being able to stay motivated after they start their fitness journeys.

# 2. Think of a potential harmful effect of your project.
- A potential harmful effect of my project is people creating goals for themselves so excessive that they may even be impossible. The project is very focused on allowing the user to have ultimate control over their fitness, but part of that means letting the user freely create goals for themselves. A users who sets an impossible goal, that user will inevitably be disappointed and potentially burnt out in regards to fitness.

# 3. Answer with an opinion and learnings so far this year:  What are pros/cons on internet blockers at router and lack of admin password on lab machines at school?
Pros include helping students stay on task and be more productive. Cons include students being unable to use certain tools that are necessary for schoolwork or productivity. For example, the blockers present at school prevent students from connecting to AWS instances without a VPN; AWS is important for APCSP, so this is actually harmful for productivity.

# 4. What concerns do you have personally about the digital divide?  For yourself or for others.
I'm concerned about people getting figuratively left behind just because they never had the opportunity to become "digitally empowered". Those who are "empowered" will almost certainly receive more opportunities in things like job opportunities.

# Other questions

## 1. Come up with three of your own Beneficial and corresponding Harmful Effects of Computing
- One beneficial effect of computing is people being able to communiate over long distances very efficiently. Digital messaging has allowed for people to stay connected despite physical limitations. However, this creates a corresponding harmful effect of people spending too much time messaging others and mixing up priorities.
- Another beneficial effect of computing is ease of sharing information. For example, modern news sites have made newspapers more or less obsolete. However this creates a corresponding harmful effect of people being able to spread misinformation extremely easily.
- One beneficial effect of computing is the simplification of peforming complicated tasks like mathematical computation. However, this has resulted in people being less competent in such tasks and overrelying on computers.

## 2. Talk about dopamine issues above. Real? Parent conspiracy? Anything that is impacting your personal study and success in High School?
Issues like those discussed in the lesson are definitely real, but the one discussed in the lesson is an extreme example that will never apply to a vast majority of people. I myself am guilty of being distracted by things like YouTube and video games, but not to an extent that is remotely close to the issue discussed in the lesson.

## 3. How does someone empower themself in a digital world?
Somebody could find ways to be more comfortable with computers and computing such as by learning how to code or learning how the internet works.
## 4. How does someone that is empowered help someone that is not empowered? Describe something you could do at Del Norte HS.
An empowered person could help somebody that isn't empowered by helping the unempowered person understand digital technologies. Something I could do at DNHS is helping classmates who are struggling in APCSP because of lack of experience.
## 5. Is paper or red tape blocking digital empowerment? Are there such barriers at Del Norte? Elsewhere?
Things like poverty stop people from being digitally empowered. Poverty stops people from even having the opportunity to use technology. Poverty exists everywhere, including Del Norte.
