- I got 24/25 on my Big Idea 2 quiz.
- The question I got wrong was question 10. I chose option C rather than option A. I failed to realize that spreadsheet one has GPA information, while spreadsheet three just has information on students with GPAs higher than 3.5. Thus, to analyze a trend in GPA, spreadsheet one is better than spreadsheet three.
