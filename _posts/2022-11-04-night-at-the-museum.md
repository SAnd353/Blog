During Night at the Museum, I looked at other APCSP projects, including "Baboon Juice" and "Fitness Forever". Beyond APCSP, I looked around at 3D Animation and Digital Media Arts. The room we had to present in was extremely cramped and stuffy.

For next trimester, I'll plan things out more exhaustively to have better time management.
