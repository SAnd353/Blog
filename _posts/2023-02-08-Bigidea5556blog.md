# When you create a GitHub repository it requests a license type. Review the license types in relationship to this Tech Talk and make some notes in your personal blog.
- Among all of the license options, I like the GPL license and MIT license the most
- I like the GPL license a bit more since no matter how people use code with a GPL license, it has to be made public (creating transparency)
# In your blog, summarize the discussions and personal analysis on Software Licenses/Options, Digital Rights, and other Legal and Ethical thoughts from this College Board topic.
- Licenses let software engineers make money off of their software.
- However, this comes with the drawback of reduced progress. If a highly important piece of software is made to be close-sourced, people may have to find inferior alternatives rather than simply using the best option.
- Yet, it is important that people can safely profit from their work if they chose to.
# Make a license for your personal (blog) and Team repositories for the CPT project. Be sure to have a license for both Team GitHub repositories (frontend/backend). Document license(s) you picked and why. FYI, frontend, since it is built on GitHub pages may come with a license and restrictions. Document in blog how team made license choice and process of update.
- My team is using the GNU GPLv3 license. 
- I liked the idea of having open-source code, but I wouldn't feel comfortable with it unless there were some restrictions.
- The GNU GPLv3 license requires people who use the code in question to provide credit and make the resulting code public, so transparency is required.
- My blog is using Apache License 2.0. This is the license of the original fastpages repository, and I feel like I shouldn't change it since the inner workings of the blog weren't made by me and came straight from the fastpages repository.

# Describe PII you have seen on project in CompSci Principles.
- I've seen names, pictures, and school names on CSP projects.
# What are your feelings about PII and your personal exposure?
- I think it is extremely important to protect PII and to reduce personal exposure as much as possible (to a reasonable extent, of course).
# Describe good and bad passwords? What is another step that is used to assist in authentication.
- Good passwords are long and complex and avoid using dictionary words.
- Another thing used to assist in authentication is multi-factor authentication, such as when users who want to log in have to provide credentials and a code that gets sent to their phone.
# Try to describe Symmetric and Asymmetric encryption.
- Symmetric encryption is encryption that is encoded and decoded with the same key.
- Asymmetric encryption is encryption that is encoded and decoded with different keys.
# Provide an example of encryption we used in AWS deployment.
- AWS encrypts server-side data with AES-256
- Furthermore, AWS uses RSA (an asymmetric cryptosystem)
# Describe a phishing scheme you have learned about the hard way. Describe some other phishing techniques.
- I can't recall a time where I've ever fell victim to phishing, but I have received emails and text messages that are obviously phishing attempts.
- These emails include some sort of call-to-action for the receiver, whether it be by creating panic or making receivers think they are on the cusp of receiving something valuable.
- For example, a phishing email can impersonate a large company and tell the receiver that they've just won a large sum of money and that the receiver just needs to click on a link to claim the money. This link may lead directly to malware.
