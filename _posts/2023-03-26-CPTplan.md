1. This trimester, I'll have to make a project for CollegeBoard's CPT requirement on the APCSP exam
2. The EOY project was assigned very recently
3. My group will be working together to meet the requirements in a timely way
4. It is very important that we don't save too much work for the days leading up to N@TM
5. This is so that we don't stress ourselves out and create a good final product
6. The finer details on our plan will be decided soon...
